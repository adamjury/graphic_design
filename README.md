# graphic_design

This is a folder of resources I have made as a graphic designer. Many — all? — of these are not some advanced rocket science, they are simple tools that do single jobs.

## photoshop_actions

### make_layercomp_artistdefault.atn

Run this when you open a new piece of art/design. It will take the current layer settings and make a layer comp named "artist_default" so you can easily revert to the settings the artist used.

In almost all situations you will want to modify layered artwork for your own purposes — removing a background color, lightening the glow/shadow, etc. Saving them as layer comps is often better than re-saving/forking the image, but you always want to be able to back up to what the artist originally intended.
